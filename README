HXTool provides additional features not directly available in the product by leveraging FireEye Endpoint Security's rich API.  

### Version ###
4.6

### Installation ###
To install HXTool:  
1. Ensure that you have a working Python installation, see the Dependencies section below for version requirements.  
2. Unzip the distribution archive; Or, if you have code repository access, fetch the repo and place the files in a directory.  
2. Install HXTool's dependencies by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" from your operating system's command shell.  
	- On Windows systems, pip.exe can be found in the "scripts" folder under your Python installation directory.  
3. After installing the dependencies, run "python hxtool.py" from your operating system's command shell and the server will start listening to tcp port 8080 (HTTPS).  
	- Alternatively, on Windows, you should be able to double-click on the "hxtool.py" file.  
4. Access the web user interface via a browser: https://127.0.0.1:8080 (tested with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox)
